# cpp-raytracer

## Overview
Cpp-Raytracer is a ray tracing project implemented in C++. It features a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) for efficient ray-object intersection tests.
You can render various shapes, materials, and textures with the ray tracer. You can also import custom models with the Wavefront OBJ format.

## Features
- Ray tracing
- Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)
- Various geometric shapes, materials, and textures
- Efficient intersection tests
- Import custom models with the Wavefront OBJ format

## Images
Here are some sample images generated by the ray tracer:

### Mashup of various shapes, textures, and materials
